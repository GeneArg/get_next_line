# Detailed Overview of Code Functions

## get_next_line
- Reads the next line from a file descriptor.
- Parameters:
  - `int fd`: File descriptor of the file.
- Algorithm:
  1. Reads data from the file descriptor into a buffer until a newline character is encountered.
  2. Creates a linked list of strings from the data.
  3. Retrieves the next line from the list.
  4. Clears the list and returns the next line.

## make_list
- Creates a linked list of strings from data read from a file descriptor.
- Parameters:
  - `t_list **list`: Pointer to the pointer to the list.
  - `int fd`: File descriptor of the file.
- Algorithm:
  1. Reads data from the file descriptor into a buffer until a newline character is encountered.
  2. Adds the buffer content into the linked list.
  3. Continues until a newline character is found.

## new_line
- Checks if any string in a linked list contains a newline character.
- Parameters:
  - `t_list *list`: Pointer to the linked list of strings.
- Algorithm:
  1. Iterates through each node in the list.
  2. Checks if any content in the node contains a newline character.
  3. Returns 1 if found, 0 otherwise.

## get_line
- Retrieves the next line from a linked list of strings.
- Parameters:
  - `t_list *list`: Pointer to the linked list of strings.
- Algorithm:
  1. Calculates the length of the next line.
  2. Copies the content of the list until a newline character is encountered into a new string.
  3. Returns the new string.

## clear_list
- Extracts the last incomplete line from a linked list, releases memory, and prepares for the next call.
- Parameters:
  - `t_list **list`: Pointer to the pointer to the list.
- Algorithm:
  1. Extracts the last incomplete line from the list.
  2. Releases memory allocated for the list.
  3. Prepares for the next call to `get_next_line`.

## add_list
- Adds a new node with the provided content to the end of a linked list.
- Parameters:
  - `t_list **list`: Pointer to the pointer to the list.
  - `char *buffer`: Pointer to the content to be added.
- Algorithm:
  1. Creates a new node with the provided content.
  2. Appends the new node to the end of the list.

## find_last
- Finds the last node in a linked list.
- Parameters:
  - `t_list *list`: Pointer to the linked list.
- Algorithm:
  1. Iterates through the list until the last node is reached.
  2. Returns a pointer to the last node.

## release
- Releases memory allocated for a linked list.
- Parameters:
  - `t_list **list`: Pointer to the pointer to the list.
  - `t_list *clean`: Pointer to a node containing the last incomplete line.
  - `char *buffer`: Pointer to the buffer for the last incomplete line.
- Algorithm:
  1. Frees memory for each node and its content in the list.
  2. Sets the list pointer to NULL.
  3. If `clean->content[0]` is not empty, assigns `clean` to the list. Otherwise, frees `clean` and `buffer`.
